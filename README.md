The web application we've developed is an engaging and dynamic platform tailored for young users, aimed at teaching them about financial management through interactive learning. Hosted on Google Cloud, it offers high availability and scalability, ready to accommodate fluctuating user traffic seamlessly. The application leverages MongoDB for robust and efficient data management. Additionally, we're in the process of establishing a CI/CD pipeline with Google Cloud Build to streamline our development and deployment workflow.
