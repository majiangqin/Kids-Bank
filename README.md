Our web application is a vibrant and interactive platform designed specifically for young users to learn about financial management. Hosted on Google Cloud using Google App Engine, it ensures high availability and scalability, seamlessly handling fluctuating user traffic. The robust infrastructure of App Engine allows us to concentrate on enhancing features without managing the underlying servers. We utilize MongoDB for effective and efficient data management. Furthermore, we are in the process of implementing a CI/CD pipeline with Google Cloud Build to optimize our development and deployment processes, ensuring continuous delivery of updates and improvements. The application also integrates a chatbot capable of answering questions about the weather, language translation, and travel to Africa.
